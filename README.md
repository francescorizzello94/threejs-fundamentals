# Three.js Fundamentals

This is the repo for my Three.js Fundamentals series published on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJUzPxH0xLf7steekQucyxQ).

The setup for this repo follows a simple principle: it should be as beginner friendly as possible.

For this reason, I have chosen to avoid creating branches for every sub-repo so that when the main repo is cloned, the user immediately has access to all the existing sub-repos and does not have to worry about learning how to use git branch commands first.
It is not the most efficient approach, but I believe it to be more conducive to an enjoyable learning experience for someone who wants to get started with three.js without having to worry about anything else apart from the code.

[This repo]() is the starting point for Box geometries.


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To use this code on your machine, you will need to follow these simple steps:

### Installation

1. Click on the green "Code" button in the top right corner of the main [Threejs Fundamentals Repository](https://github.com/francescorizzello94/threejs-fundamentals)
2. Select SSH and copy the link
3. In your local terminal, use the command below (you could also just copy paste the command and it would still work, of course)
   ```sh
   git clone git@github.com:francescorizzello94/threejs-fundamentals.git
   ```
3. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm i
   ```
   which is the same as

4. Pull the latest updates to the repo to stay updated with any new sub-repos I may have added since cloning
   ```sh
   git pull
